            <h2>Crown Prince zoku</h2>
            <p><b>Zuko is a Fire Nation royal</b> and firebending master who reigned as Fire Lord from 100 AG until his abdication in 167 AG. He is the eldest child and only son of Princess Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai. Originally the primary enemy of Team Avatar, Zuko devoted three years to trying to capture the long-lost Avatar to end his banishment and regain his honor as Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. He is recognizable by the distinctive burn scar on the left side of his face, which was given to him by his father, Ozai, shortly before his banishment as a result of an incident in which he unintentionally disrespected his father by speaking out of turn and refusing to duel him.</p>

            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Zuko is a complex character who demonstrates a number of contradictory traits, beliefs, and behaviors. As Fire Nation royalty, he has a superiority complex and considers many people to be inferior to him. Though at the same time he has a great sense of justice and refuses to view people as expendable. Zuko felt that he did not need luck so he could be the master of his own fate; but he also believed that he was "lucky to be born" in contrast to Azula who was "born lucky", and that his bad luck had turned the whole world against him.</li>
                <li>He is skilled in "Dao duel-wielding," as in the episode "The Blue Spirit" wherein he withstands a large number of adversaries. In "Avatar: The Lost Adventures," it was revealed that he studied under Master Piandao, his uncle's colleague and Sokka's master sword fighting instructor. Zuko has also demonstrated an ability in stealth and unarmed combat, as when able to infiltrate a Fire Nation fortress, the Northern Water Tribe's city, and the Dai Li's base in the Earth Kingdom without detection.</li>
